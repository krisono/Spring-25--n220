## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project is going to be about having a better system. This system will allow users to navigae through the museum options easily. I chose this topic because some pof the screens at the museum wasnt working properly and was glicthy as well.

### Core Webpages

The main page will include the menus. THis poage will also have a button that allows users to go back to the perios screen. It would also allow users to see a catalog of options like a help page. 

### Design Choices

Im going to use https://www.indianapoliszoo.com/ as a starting template to give me ideas on how the screen should look. Im also going to use vibrant colors to make it more fun to navigate around.
